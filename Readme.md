# NHL 2018
This is code to predict standings at the end of the 2018-19 NHL season and predict the winner of the Stanley Cup. The code also allows to rank teams based on a balanced 82 games season to rank teams correcting for the strength of their schedule.

The code could be further optimized, especially in the part for ranking teams. 

If you use the code and improve it, please let me know. I wish to learn and improve what I've done..
